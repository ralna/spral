! LSMR   solves Ax = b or min ||Ax - b|| with or without damping,
! using the iterative algorithm of David Fong and Michael Saunders:

! This version uses reverse communication so that control is passed back
! to the user to perform products with A or A' and to perform preconditioning.
! In addition, the user may choose to use their own stopping rule(s)
! or to apply the stopping criteria of Fong and Saunders.
! A number of options are available (see the derived type lsmr_type_options).
!
!    Dec 2015: SPRAL version developed to allow user more control
!              over preconditioning. Also comprehensive test deck written.
! 23 Nov 2015: revised reverse communication interface written by
!              Nick Gould and Jennifer Scott.
!              lsmrDataModule.f90 no longer used.
!              Automatic arrays no longer used.
!              Option for user to test convergence (or to use Fong and
!              Saunders test).
!              Uses dnrm2 and dscal (for closer compatibility with
!              Fong and Saunders code ... easier to compare results).
!              Sent to Saunders; made available on above SOL webpage.
! 20 May 2014: initial reverse-communication version written by Nick Gould
! 02 May 2014: With damp>0, flag=2 was incorrectly set to flag=3
!              (so incorrect stopping message was printed).  Fixed.
! 28 Jan 2014: In lsmrDataModule.f90:
!              ip added for integer(ip) declarations.
!              dnrm2 and dscal coded directly
!              (no longer use lsmrblasInterface.f90 or lsmrblas.f90).
! 07 Sep 2010: Local reorthogonalization now works (localSize > 0).
! 17 Jul 2010: F90 LSMR derived from F90 LSQR and lsqr.m.
!              Aprod1, Aprod2 implemented via f90 interface.

    ! Precision
    ! ---------
    ! The number of iterations required by LSMR will decrease
    ! if the computation is performed in higher precision.
    ! At least 15-digit arithmetic should normally be used.
    ! "real(wp)" declarations should normally be 8-byte words.

  ! LSMR  finds a solution x to the following problems:
  !
  ! 1. Unsymmetric equations:    Solve  A*x = b
  !
  ! 2. Linear least squares:     Solve  A*x = b
  !                              in the least-squares sense
  !
  ! 3. Damped least squares:     Solve  (   A    )*x = ( b )
  !                                     ( damp*I )     ( 0 )
  !                              in the least-squares sense
  !
  ! where A is a matrix with m rows and n columns, b is an m-vector,
  ! and damp is a scalar.  (All quantities are real.)
  ! The matrix A is treated as a linear operator.  It is accessed
  ! by reverse communication, that is requests for matrix-vector
  ! products are passed back to the user.
  !
  ! If preconditioning used, solves
  ! 1. Unsymmetric equations:    Solve  AP*y = b
  !
  ! 2. Linear least squares:     Solve  AP*y = b
  !                              in the least-squares sense
  !
  ! 3. Damped least squares:     Solve  (   A    )*P*y = ( b )
  !                                     ( damp*I )       ( 0 )
  !                              in the least-squares sense
  ! Code computes y and user must recover x = Py
  !
  ! LSMR uses an iterative method to approximate the solution.
  ! The number of iterations required to reach a certain accuracy
  ! depends strongly on the scaling of the problem.  Poor scaling of
  ! the rows or columns of A should therefore be avoided where
  ! possible.
  !
  ! For example, in problem 1 the solution is unaltered by
  ! row-scaling.  If a row of A is very small or large compared to
  ! the other rows of A, the corresponding row of ( A  b ) should be
  ! scaled up or down.
  !
  ! In problems 1 and 2, the solution x is easily recovered
  ! following column-scaling.  Unless better information is known,
  ! the nonzero columns of A should be scaled so that they all have
  ! the same Euclidean norm (e.g., 1.0).
  !
  ! In problem 3, there is no freedom to re-scale if damp is
  ! nonzero.  However, the value of damp should be assigned only
  ! after attention has been paid to the scaling of A.
  !
  ! The parameter damp is intended to help regularize
  ! ill-conditioned systems, by preventing the true solution from
  ! being very large.  Another aid to regularization is provided by
  ! the parameter condAP, which may be used to terminate iterations
  ! before the computed solution becomes very large.
  !
  ! Note that x is not an input parameter.
  ! If some initial estimate x0 is known and if damp = 0,
  ! one could proceed as follows:
  !
  ! 1. Compute a residual vector     r0 = b - A*x0.
  ! 2. Use LSMR to solve the system  A*dx = r0.
  ! 3. Add the correction dx to obtain a final solution x = x0 + dx.
  !
  ! This requires that x0 be available before the first call
  ! to LSMR and after the final call.
  ! To judge the benefits, suppose LSMR takes k1 iterations
  ! to solve A*x = b and k2 iterations to solve A*dx = r0.
  ! If x0 is "good", norm(r0) will be smaller than norm(b).
  ! If the same stopping tolerances atol and btol are used for each
  ! system, k1 and k2 will be similar, but the final solution x0 + dx
  ! should be more accurate.  The only way to reduce the total work
  ! is to use a larger stopping tolerance for the second system.
  ! If some value btol is suitable for A*x = b, the larger value
  ! btol*norm(b)/norm(r0)  should be suitable for A*dx = r0.
  !
  ! Preconditioning is another way to reduce the number of iterations.
  ! If it is possible to solve a related system M*x = b efficiently,
  ! where M approximates A in some helpful way
  ! (e.g. M - A has low rank or its elements are small relative to
  ! those of A), LSMR may converge more rapidly on the system
  !       A*M(inverse)*y = b, ie AP*y = b with P = M(inverse)
  ! after which x can be recovered by solving M*x = y (ie x = Py).
  ! Observe that, if options%ctest = 3 is used (Fong and Saunders stopping)
  ! then the convergence will be in the preconditioner norm.
  ! If options%ctest /= 3, the user may choose the norm that is
  ! used for the stopping criteria.
  !
  ! Currently, the user must combine applying the preconditioner
  ! with performing matrix-vector products
  ! eg suppose we have an incomplete factorization LL^T for A'A and we
  ! are going to use this as a preconditioner.
  ! Let the LS problem be  min||Ay - b||.
  ! When LSMR requires products A*v, the user should compute AL^{-T}*v.
  ! And when A'*v is required, the user should compute L^{-1}A'*v.
  ! On completion, the user must recover the required solution y
  ! by solving y = L^T*x, where x is the solution returned by LSMR.
  ! In a future release, we may include separate returns for preconditioning
  ! operations by extending the range of action values.
  ! This will allow LSMR to return y to the user.
  !
  ! NOTE: If A is symmetric, LSMR should not be used!
  ! Alternatives are the symmetric conjugate-gradient method (CG)
  ! and/or SYMMLQ.
  ! SYMMLQ is an implementation of symmetric CG that applies to
  ! any symmetric A and will converge more rapidly than LSMR.
  ! If A is positive definite, there are other implementations of
  ! symmetric CG that require slightly less work per iteration
  ! than SYMMLQ (but will take the same number of iterations).

  ! Notation
  ! --------
  ! The following quantities are used in discussing the subroutine
  ! parameters:
  !
  ! Abar   =  (  A   )P,        bbar  =  (b)
  !           (damp*I)                   (0)
  !
  ! r      =  b - AP*y,         rbar  =  bbar - Abar*y
  !
  ! normr  =  sqrt( norm(r)**2  +  damp**2 * norm(y)**2 )
  !        =  norm( rbar )
  !
  ! eps    =  the relative precision of floating-point arithmetic.
  !           On most machines, eps is about 1.0e-7 and 1.0e-16
  !           in single and double precision respectively.
  !           We expect eps to be about 1e-16 always.
  !
  ! LSMR  minimizes the function normr with respect to y.

     real(wp)    :: atol = sqrt(epsilon(one))
     ! Used if ctest = 3 (Fong and Saunders stopping criteria)
     ! In which case, must hold an estimate of the relative error in the data
     ! defining the matrix A.  For example, if A is accurate to about 6 digits,
     ! set atol = 1.0e-6.

     real(wp)    :: btol = sqrt(epsilon(one))
     ! Used if ctest = 3 (Fong and Saunders stopping criteria)
     ! In which case, must hold an estimate of the relative error in the data
     ! defining the rhs b.  For example, if b is
     ! accurate to about 6 digits, set btol = 1.0e-6.

     real(wp)    :: conlim = 1/(10*sqrt(epsilon(one)))
     ! Used if ctest = 3 (Fong and Saunders stopping criteria)
     ! In which case, must hold an upper limit on cond(Abar), the apparent
     ! condition number of the matrix Abar. Iterations will be terminated
     ! if a computed estimate of cond(Abar) exceeds conlim.
     ! This is intended to prevent certain small or
     ! zero singular values of A or Abar from
     ! coming into effect and causing unwanted growth in the computed solution.

     ! conlim and damp may be used separately or
     ! together to regularize ill-conditioned systems.

     ! Normally, conlim should be in the range 1000 to 1/eps.
     ! Suggested value:
     ! conlim = 1/(100*eps)  for compatible systems,
     ! conlim = 1/(10*sqrt(eps)) for least squares.

     ! Note: Any or all of atol, btol, conlim may be set to zero.
     ! The effect will be the same as the values eps, eps, 1/eps.

     ! 3 : The code determines if convergence has been achieved using
     !     Fong and Saunders stopping criteria.
     !     inform holds the latest estimates of normAP, condAP, normr, normAPr,
     !     normy.

     integer(ip) :: itnlim = -1
     ! must hold an upper limit on the number of iterations.
     ! Suggested value:
     ! itnlim = n/2  for well-conditioned systems with clustered singular values
     ! itnlim = 4*n  otherwise. If itnlim = -1 then we use 4*n.

     integer(ip) :: itn_test = -1
     ! Determines how often control is passed to use to allow convergence
     ! testing. It itn_test = -1 we use min(n,10).

     integer(ip) :: localSize = 0
     ! No. of vectors for local reorthogonalization.
     ! 0       No reorthogonalization is performed.
     ! >0      This many n-vectors "v" (the most recent ones)
