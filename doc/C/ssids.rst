SSIDS - Sparse Symmetric Indefinite Direct Solver
*************************************************

.. code-block:: C

   #include <spral_ssids.h> /* or <spral.h> for all packages */

=======
Purpose
=======

This package solves one or more sets of :math:`n\times n`
sparse **symmetric** equations  :math:`AX = B` using a multifrontal method.
The following cases are covered:

1. :math:`A` is **indefinite**.
SSIDS computes the sparse factorization

.. math::

   A =  PLD(PL)^T

where :math:`P` is a permutation matrix, :math:`L` is unit lower triangular,
and :math:`D` is block diagonal with blocks of size :math:`1 \times 1`
and :math:`2 \times 2`.

2. :math:`A` is **positive definite**.
SSIDS computes the **sparse Cholesky factorization**

.. math::

   A =  PL(PL)^T

where :math:`P` is a permutation matrix and :math:`L` is lower triangular.
*However, as SSIDS is designed primarily for indefinite
systems, this may be slower than a dedicated Cholesky solver.*

The code optionally supports hybrid computation using one or more NVIDIA GPUs.

SSIDS returns bit-compatible results.

An option exists to scale the matrix. In this case, the factorization of
the scaled matrix  :math:`\overline{A} = S A S` is computed,
where :math:`S` is a diagonal scaling matrix.

==============
Usage overview
==============

Solving :math:`AX=B` using SSIDS is a four stage process.

1. Call :c:func:`spral_ssids_analyse()` to perform a symbolic factorization,
   stored in `akeep`.
2. Call :c:func:`spral_ssids_factor()` to perform a numeric factorization,
   stored in `fkeep`. More than one numeric factorization can refer to the same
   `akeep`.
3. Call :c:func:`spral_ssids_solve1()` or :c:func:`spral_ssids_solve()` to
   perform a solve with the factors. More than one solve can be performed with
   the same `fkeep`.
4. Once all desired solutions have been performed, free memory with
   :c:func:`spral_ssids_free()`.

In addition, advanced users may use the following routines:

* :c:func:`spral_ssids_enquire_posdef()` and
  :c:func:`spral_ssids_enquire_indef()` return
  the diagonal entries of the factors and the pivot sequence.
* :c:func:`spral_ssids_alter()` allows altering the diagonal entries of the
  factors.


.. note::

   **Bit-compatibility:**
   If used with bit-compatible BLAS and compiler options, this routine will
   return bit compatible results. That is, consecutive runs with the same data
   on the same machine produces exactly the same solution.

Basic Subroutines
=================

.. note::
   
   For the most efficient use of the package, CSC format should be used
   without checking.

.. c:function:: void spral_ssids_default_options(struct spral_ssids_options *options)

   Intialises members of options structure to default values.

   :param options: Structure to be initialised.

.. c:function:: void spral_ssids_analyse(bool check, int n, int *order, const int64_t *ptr, const int *row, const double *val, void **akeep, const struct spral_ssids_options *options, struct spral_ssids_inform *inform)

   Perform the analyse (symbolic) phase of the factorization for a matrix
   supplied in :doc:`CSC format<csc_format>`. The resulting symbolic factors
   stored in :c:type:`akeep` should be passed unaltered in the following call to
   :c:func:`spral_ssids_factor()`.

   :param check: if true, matrix data is checked. Out-of-range entries
      are dropped and duplicate entries are summed.
   :param n: number of columns in :math:`A`.
   :param order: may be `NULL`; otherwise must be an array of size `n`
      used on entry a user-supplied ordering
      (:c:type:`options.ordering=0 <spral_ssids_options.ordering>`).
      On return, the actual ordering used.
   :param ptr[n+1]: column pointers for :math:`A`
      (see :doc:`CSC format<csc_format>`).
   :param row[ptr[n]]: row indices for :math:`A`
      (see :doc:`CSC format<csc_format>`).
   :param val: may be `NULL`; otherwise must be an array of size `ptr[n]`
      containing non-zero values for :math:`A`
      (see :doc:`CSC format<csc_format>`).
      Only used if a matching-based ordering is requested.
   :param akeep: returns symbolic factorization, to be passed unchanged to
      subsequent routines.
   :param options: specifies algorithm options to be used
      (see :c:type:`spral_ssids_options`).
   :param inform: returns information about the execution of the routine
      (see :c:type:`spral_ssids_inform`).

   .. note::

      If a user-supplied ordering is used, it may be altered by this routine,
      with the altered version returned in `order[]`. This version will be
      equivalent to the original ordering, except that some supernodes may have
      been amalgamated, a topographic ordering may have been applied to the
      assembly tree and the order of columns within a supernode may have been
      adjusted to improve cache locality.

.. c:function:: void spral_ssids_analyse_ptr32(bool check, int n, int *order, const int *ptr, const int *row, const double *val, void **akeep, const struct spral_ssids_options *options, struct spral_ssids_inform *inform)

   As :c:func:`spral_ssids_analyse()`, except ptr has type ``int``.
   Provided for backwards comptability, users are encourage to use 64-bit ptr
   in new code.

.. c:function:: void spral_ssids_analyse_coord(int n, int *order, int64_t ne, const int *row, const int *col, const double *val, void **akeep, const struct spral_ssids_options *options, struct spral_ssids_inform *inform)

   As :c:func:`spral_ssids_analyse()`, but for coordinate data. The variant
   parameters are:

   :param ne: number of non-zero entries in :math:`A`.
   :param row[ne]: row indices for :math:`A`
      (see :doc:`Coordinate format<coord_format>`).
   :param col[ne]: column indices for :math:`A`
      (see :doc:`Coordinate format<coord_format>`).

.. c:function:: void spral_ssids_factor(bool posdef, const int64_t *ptr, const int *row, const double *val, double *scale, void *akeep, void **fkeep, const struct spral_ssids_options *options, struct spral_ssids_inform *inform)

   :param posdef: true if matrix is positive-definite
   :param ptr: may be `NULL`; otherwise a length `n+1` array of column pointers
      for :math:`A`, only required if :f:type:`akeep` was obtained by running
      :c:func:`spral_ssids_analyse()` with `check=true`, in which case it must
      be unchanged since that call.
   :param row: may be `NULL`; otherwise a length `ptr[n]` array of row indices
      for :math:`A`, only required if :f:type:`akeep` was obtained by running
      :c:func:`spral_ssids_analyse()` with `check=true`, in which case it must
      be unchanged since that call.
   :param val[]: non-zero values for :math:`A` in same format as for
      the call to :c:func:`spral_ssids_analyse()` or
      :c:func:`spral_ssids_analyse_coord()`.
   :param scale: may be `NULL`; otherwise a length `n` array for diagonal
      scaling. `scale[i-1]` contains entry :math:`S_ii` of :math:`S`. Must be
      supplied by user on entry if
      :c:member:`options.scaling=0 <spral_ssids_options.scaling>` (user-supplied
      scaling). On exit, returns scaling used.
   :param akeep: symbolic factorization returned by preceding call to
      :c:func:`ssids_analyse()` or :c:func:`ssids_analyse_coord()`.
   :param fkeep: returns numeric factorization, to be passed unchanged
      to subsequent routines.
   :param options: specifies algorithm options to be used
      (see :c:type:`spral_ssids_options`).

      |             | communication pattern is used, but a single failed pivot |
      |             | requires restart of node factorization and potential     |

Example
=======

Suppose we wish to factorize the matrix

.. math::

   A = \left(\begin{array}{ccccc}
      2. & 1.                \\
      1. & 4. & 1. &    & 1. \\
         & 1. & 3. & 2.      \\
         &    & 2. & -1. &    \\
         & 1. &    &    & 2.
   \end{array}\right)

and then solve for the right-hand side

.. math::

   B = \left(\begin{array}{c}
      4.    \\
      17.   \\
      19.   \\
      2.    \\
      12.
   \end{array}\right).

The following code may be used.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/C/ssids.c
   :language: C


This produces the following output::

   The computed solution is:
      1.0000000000e+00   2.0000000000e+00   3.0000000000e+00   4.0000000000e+00   5.0000000000e+00
   Pivot order:     2     3     0    -1     1

======
Method
======

Partition of work across available resources
--------------------------------------------

Once the ordering has been determined and the assembly tree determined in the
analyse phase, the tree is broken into a number of leaf subtrees rooted at a
single node, leaving a root subtree/forest consisting of all remaining nodes
above those. Each leaf subtree is pre-assigned to a particular NUMA region or
GPU for the factorization phase. Details of the algorithm used for
finding these subtrees and their assignment can be found in the paper [2]_.

The factorization phase has two steps. In the first, leaf subtrees are
factorized in parallel on their assigned resources. Once all leaf subtrees are
factored, the second phase begins where all CPU resources cooperate to factorize
the root subtree.

At present the solve phase is performed in serial.

Data checking
-------------

If check is set to .true. on the call to :c:func:`spral_ssids_analyse()` or if
:c:func:`spral_ssids_analyse_coord()` is called, the user-supplied matrix data is
checked for errors. The cleaned integer matrix data (duplicates are
summed and out-of-range indices discarded) is stored in akeep. The use
of checking is optional on a call to :c:func:`spral_ssids_analyse()` as it incurs both
time and memory overheads. However, it is recommended since the
behaviour of the other routines in the package is unpredictable if
duplicates and/or out-of-range variable indices are entered.

If the user has supplied an elimination order it is checked for errors.
Otherwise, an elimination order is generated by the package. The
elimination order is used to construct an assembly tree. On exit from
:c:func:`spral_ssids_analyse()` (and :c:func:`spral_ssids_analyse_coord()`), `order[]` is
set so that `order[i]` holds the position of variable :math:`i` in the
elimination order. If an ordering was supplied by the user, this order may
differ, but will be equivalent in terms of fill-in.

Factorization performed
-----------------------

The factorization performed depends on the value of `posdef`.

If **posdef=true**, a Cholesky factorization is performed:

.. math:: SAS = PL(PL)^T.

Pivoting is not performed, so :math:`P` is the permutation determined in the
analysis phase. :math:`S` is a diagonal scaling matrix.

If **posdef=false**, a symmetric indefinite factorization is performed:

.. math:: SAS = PLD(PL)^T

Pivoting is performed, so :math:`P` may differ from the permutation determined
in the analysis phase, though it is kept as close as possible to minimize fill.
The exact pivoting algorithm varies depending on the particular kernel the
algorithm chooses to employ.

Full details of the algorithms used are provided in [1]_ for GPUs and [2]_ for
CPUs.

.. _ssids_small_leaf:

Small Leaf Subtrees
-------------------

For subtrees allocated to run on the CPU, the factorization of small nodes near
the leaves of the tree can be amalgamated into a single parallel task (normally
each would be treated as its own OpenMP task to be scheduled). This can reduce
scheduling overheads, especially on small problems. If the total number of
operations for a subtree root at a given node is less than
:c:member:`options.small_subtree_threshold <spral_ssids_options.small_subtree_threshold>`,
that subtree is treated as a single task.
